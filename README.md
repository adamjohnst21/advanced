This repository contains 2 main folders:

1. aj_homepage
  -All the content for Adam Johnston's python portfolio website
  -Including HTMl, CSS, and page specific downloads
  
2. practicals
  -The content required for the Advanced-programming portfolio submission for MSc GIS @ Leeds
  -Deliverables include Arcpy addins and jupyter notebooks 
  
All Advanced programming content can be accessed via adamjohnst21.github.io/advanced/aj_home

I realise it might be better to host the site from adamjohnst21.github.io, but my reasoning for
not doing so is that I know later this semester we are given a talk about having our own webiste
as part of PPD, so I might want to reserve this URL for a main Adam J page.
